This project reflects the learning gained from working through two tasks on financial time-series analysis. The first notebook helped build a clear understanding of how to handle real market data before doing any analysis. I learned how important it is to work with adjusted prices, deal properly with missing values, and compute returns in a consistent way. While doing this, I also realized how the same asset can behave very differently across time periods, and how returns, volatility, and trends only start making sense once the data is cleaned and structured properly.

The exploratory analysis in the first task also reinforced that financial datasets cannot be taken at face value. I learned to question the data, check assumptions, and look at distributions and summary statistics before drawing conclusions. Comparing long-term and crisis-period behavior showed how markets shift under stress, and that historical performance is always context-dependent rather than absolute.

The second notebook shifted the focus from data preparation to evaluation discipline. Here, I understood why naive prediction models are not useless, but instead act as essential baselines. By testing very simple predictors, like persistence or mean return estimates, I learned how to judge whether a future model is genuinely better or just appears to perform well because of poor evaluation practices.

The walk-forward validation process was one of the key conceptual takeaways. I learned that time-series problems must respect chronological order, and that using random train-test splits can create misleading performance impressions. Building a simple position-based strategy from predictions made this even clearer, because I could see how results change when predictions are generated in a realistic way rather than with hindsight.

Overall, the most important learning from these tasks was not about building profitable strategies, but about discipline. I learned that financial modeling is fundamentally about correctness, transparency, and avoiding shortcuts that distort results. These notebooks emphasized that strong groundwork, clean data, and rigorous evaluation matter more than complexity, especially at the early stages of quantitative analysis.
